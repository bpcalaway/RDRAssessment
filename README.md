Homework for VMC

[Initial]
- Assumptions:
    - Modern Python 3 installation
    - Postgres is installed and set up
    - pip is available and basic modules can be installed by tox
- If any of these are not available, links can be found below:
    - pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
    - postgres: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

[Commands]
- Todo: set the tox install and initial table creation scripts

[Config]
- Users will need to view the config.json file and edit their personal details from when they set up postgres on their local machine, loading up postgres in a shell should allow users to verify they have the correct information.
